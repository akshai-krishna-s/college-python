# AIM: Write a program to find the area and circumference of a circle

# Source Code:
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

area = 3.14 * radius * radius
circumference = 2 * 3.14 * radius

print("The area of the circle is: ", area)
print("The circumference of the circle is: ", circumference)

# Output:
# Enter the radius of the circle: 5
# The area of the circle is:  78.5
# The circumference of the circle is:  31.400000000000002
